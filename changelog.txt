#----------------------------------- 0.21 ------------------------------------
[fixed] upload for rom 0.20 was missing new columns.py, now fixed
#----------------------------------- 0.20 ------------------------------------
[changed] Added exception when performing .all(), .execute(), or .count() on
    query objects that have had no filters or attribute ordering provided.
    This addresses issue #12.
[changed] Moved column definitions to their own module, shouldn't affect any
    normal uses of rom.
[added] For users of Redis 2.6 and later, there is a beta Lua-enabled writing
    option that allows for multiple unique columns on models. In some cases,
    this may improve performance when writing many entities very quickly.
[added] The ability to reload an entity from Redis, optionally discarding any
    modifications to the object itself. Check out the documentation for
    Model.refresh(), Session.refresh(), and Session.refresh_all()
[added] Tests for the newly changed/added features.
[changed] Tests no longer use flushdb() - all test models/indexes/etc. are
    prefixed with RomTest, and we find/delete such keys before and after any
    tests are run. Now anyone can reasonably run the test suite.
#----------------------------------- 0.19 ------------------------------------
[fixed] Thanks to a bug report by https://github.com/MickeyKim , was notified
    of a bug when using unique indexes, which is now fixed and has a testcase.
#----------------------------------- 0.18 ------------------------------------
[fixed] Thanks to a bug report by https://github.com/MickeyKim , was notified
    and received an interim patch for a bug that could cause deleted entities
    to be resurrected on session.commit() or session.flush() . This has now
    been fixed and a testcase has been added.
#----------------------------------- 0.17 ------------------------------------
[added] LGPL 3 licensing option.
#----------------------------------- 0.16 ------------------------------------
[added] Thanks to a feature request from https://github.com/jrsmith , Boolean
    column support is now available.
[added] DateTime, Date, and Time column types because I was already adding
    Boolean columns.
#----------------------------------- 0.15 ------------------------------------
[fixed] Thanks to https://github.com/MickeyKim who fixed Json columns so that
    they round-trip after multiple saves.
#----------------------------------- 0.14 ------------------------------------
[fixed] Thanks to https://github.com/mayfield the manifest is fixed for the
    source installation.
#----------------------------------- 0.13 ------------------------------------
[fixed] updating a model will no longer unindex the model on attributes that
    weren't updated. Thanks to https://github.com/mayfield for the bug report,
    analysis, and initial pull request that ultimately resulted in the fix.
[fixed] pip requires, versioning, etc., thanks to fixes from
    https://github.com/mayfield
[changed] Model.get_by() will now work on any type of indexed columns. Unique
    columns work as before, and other columns get pass-through to the
    Model.query interface.
[changed] Model.get_by() and Model.query.filter() will both accept single
    numbers as the value to match on (you don't need to specify a range if you
    are querying by equality).
[changed] all changes will be documented in this changelog.txt file to keep a
    list of everything that is going on with the project.

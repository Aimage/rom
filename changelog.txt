    analysis, and initial pull request that ultimately resulted in the fix.

[changed] Model.get_by() will now work on any type of indexed columns. Unique
    columns work as before, and other columns get pass-through to the
    Model.query interface.
[changed] Model.get_by() and Model.query.filter() will both accept single
    numbers as the value to match on (you don't need to specify a range if you
    are querying by equality).
[changed] all changes will be documented in this changelog.txt file to keep a
    list of everything that is going on with the project.

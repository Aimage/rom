#----------------------------------- 0.13 ------------------------------------
[fixed] updating a model will no longer unindex the model on attributes that
    weren't updated. Thanks to https://github.com/mayfield for the bug report,
    analysis, and initial pull request that ultimately resulted in the fix.
[fixed] pip requires, versioning, etc., thanks to fixes from
    https://github.com/mayfield
[changed] Model.get_by() will now work on any type of indexed columns. Unique
    columns work as before, and other columns get pass-through to the
    Model.query interface.
[changed] Model.get_by() and Model.query.filter() will both accept single
    numbers as the value to match on (you don't need to specify a range if you
    are querying by equality).
[changed] all changes will be documented in this changelog.txt file to keep a
    list of everything that is going on with the project.
